You died =(. You got {0} of the buggers first though!
I hope you learned some neat things from the dying screams of your enemies.
The full list can be found in the game folder, under "res". The filename is
screams.txt. The format may look a little weird, but is very simple, Any line
ending with \ continues onto the next line. Otherwise, it's the start of a 
new quote.
Close the game and reopen it to replay!
