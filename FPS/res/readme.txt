This is the readme file for "Defend Rome"
In this game, you are Horatius Cocles, an officer in the Roman army.
Your unit, commanders, and compatriots have deserted you (the cowards!)
You must defend Rome against an onslought of Etruscan Soldiers. Fortunatly, you
have a few things going for you.
    - You have a sword
    - Tiberinus, the Genius Loci of the Tiber river has been kind enough to
        transform any approching Etruscan soldier into a blob. Unfortunaly,
        they are now made of a highly toxic compound, and will damage you
        upon contact.
===============================================================================
CONTROLS:
    - WASD for Forward/Backward/Strafe left/Strafe right
    - Mouse to look around.
    - Left click to attack!
===============================================================================
Deviations from the original myth:
    - Obviously, Tiberinus did not transform the Etruscans into blobs. I took a
        bit of creative liberty here, because I am unable to model humanoid
        characters.
    - Where is Rome, you ask? It's hidden by fog.
