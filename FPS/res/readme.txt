This is the readme file for "Defend Rome"
In this game, you are Horatius Cocles, an officer in the Roman army.
Your unit, commanders, and compatriots have deserted you (the cowards!)
You must defend Rome against an onslought of Etruscan Soldiers. Fortunatly, you
have a few things going for you.
    - You have a sword
    - Tiberinus, the Genius Loci of the Tiber river has been kind enough to
        transform any approching Etruscan soldiers into a blob. Unfortunaly,
        they are now made of a highly toxic compound, and will damage you
        upon contact.
Unfortuatly, you cannot win. Take out as many of the evil buggers as you can
before you go!
================================================================================
CONTROLS:
    - WASD for Forward/Backward/Strafe left/Strafe right
    - Mouse to look around.
    - Left click to attack!
    - Your health is displayed in the top left corner of the screen.
        You can take 5 seconds of contact before you die.
================================================================================
Deviations from the original myth:
    - Obviously, Tiberinus did not transform the Etruscans into blobs. I took a
        bit of creative liberty here, because I am unable to model humanoid
        characters.
    - In the original myth, Horatius manages to hold the Etruscans off long
    	enough for the bridge to be destroyed. He then jumps in the river and
    	swims across. In this game, you are not so lucky. Defeat is inevitable.
    - Where is Rome, you ask? It's hidden by fog.
================================================================================
Known bad things:
    - There is no sound, so the blobs sort of sneak up on you and you start
        dying.
    - The UI is awful because I ran out of time.
    - The quotes are missing long marks because I was unable to find versions
        with correct markings.
