This is the readme file for "Defend Rome"
In this game, you are Horatius Cocles, an officer in the Roman army.
Your unit, commanders, and compatriots have deserted you (the cowards!)
You must defend Rome against an onslought of Etruscan Soldiers. Fortunatly, you
have a few things going for you.
    - You have a sword
    - Tiberinus, the Genius Loci of the Tiber river has been kind enough to
        transform any approching Etruscan soldiers into a blob. Unfortunaly,
        they are now made of a highly toxic compound, and will damage you
        upon contact.
Unfortuatly, you cannot win. Take out as many of the evil buggers as you can
before you go!
================================================================================
CONTROLS:
    - WASD for Forward/Backward/Strafe left/Strafe right
    - Mouse to look around.
    - Left click to attack!
    - Your health is displayed in the top left corner of the screen.
================================================================================
Deviations from the original myth:
    - Obviously, Tiberinus did not transform the Etruscans into blobs. I took a
        bit of creative liberty here, because I am unable to model humanoid
        characters.
    - In the original story of Horatius, he is able to defeat the Etruscan army.
        I divorced from the myth here for gameplay reasons and time limitations.
    - Where is Rome, you ask? It's hidden by fog.
================================================================================
Known bad things:
    - There is no sound, so the blobs sort of sneak up on you and you start
        dying.
    - The UI is awful because I ran out of time.
    - There are missing long marks on the quotes because of technical
        limitations.
